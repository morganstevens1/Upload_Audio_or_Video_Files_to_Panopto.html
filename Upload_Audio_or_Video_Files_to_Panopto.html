        Did you know that Panopto is a video- and an audio-streaming service, like YouTube
        or Vimeo? In addition to using it to record lectures and presentations <a href="https://techdocs.blogs.brynmawr.edu/7192">
        at home </a> or <a href ="https://techdocs.blogs.brynmawr.edu/7192">in classrooms</a>,
        you can also <b><i>upload audio and video created or recorded elsewhere into Panopto</i></b>
        in order to share them with others.
        <ol>
            <li type="circle">
                This option is only available in the Panopto web portal (<a href="https://brynmawr.hostel.panopto.com">https://brynmawr.hostel.panopto.com</a>),
                not the desktop app used for recording.
            </li>
            <li type="circle">
                Panopto supports major media file formats, including MP3, MP4, AVI, MOV, and ASF.
                See <a href ="https://support.panopto.com/s/article/Supported-File-Types">Supported File Types</a>
                for details.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        To upload an audio or video file to Panopto:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Log into the Panopto web portal by one of the following methods:
        </li>
        <li type = "circle">
            Go to <a href="https://brynmawr.hosted.panopto.com">https://brynmawr.hosted.</a>
        </li>
        <li type = "circle">
            Log into a Moodle course where you are a Teacher role, chlick on the <b>Course Settings</b>
            link in the Panopto block, and then exit the course settings tab.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click the dark blue <strong>Create</strong> button, and choose <strong>Media</strong> 
            from the drop-down menu, as shown below.
        </li>
        <img src="audiovideo1.png" alt=" " height = "300" width = "500">
        <li>
            Click the <b>Add Files to</b> drop-down menu and choose the folder where you want to place your files.
        </li>
        <img src="audiovideo2.png" alt=" " height = "300" width = "500">
        <li>
            Upload files by either:
        </li>
        <li type = "circle">
            Dragging them into the box labeled <b>Drag video or audio files here...</b> OR
        </li>
        <li type = "circle">
            Clicking on that box, browsing for files on your comptuer, selecting them and clicking <b>Open</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            A check mark will appear by each file when it has finished uploading; Panopto will alert you when it is
            safe to close the window.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Note that Panopto may continue to process media for several minutes after the upload finished. This is normal,
        and time required depends on the recording length/file size, the media formatting and the server load. Once the 
        processing is complete, you can generate a <a href = "https://techdocs.blogs.brynmawr.edu/8701">shareable link</a>
        to add to a Moodle site or web page.(Note: you can also <a href = "https://support.panopto.com/s/article/merge-and-copy-1">copy or move the video</a>)
        to the panopto folder for a Moodle course, and it will appear in the Panopto block in that course).
    </p>
    <p>
        To add the link to your Moodle site: 
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            On your Moodle course page, click the <b>Turn Editing On</b> button located toward the top right of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
            Locate where you would like to place the link and select <b>Add an activity or resource.</b>
        </li>
        <img src = "audiovideo3.png" alt = "" height = "50" width = "200">
        <li>
            From the menu that comes up, choose the <b>URL</b> activity and then click <b>Add</b>
        </li>
        <img src = "audiovideo4.png" alt = " " height = "50" width = "200">
        <li>
            In the new window that appears, you will be able to give your URL a <b>Name</b>. The name is the text that will
            be displayed linking to your video. For example, you can title your link "Firm clip for Week 1."
        </li>
        <img src = "audiovideo5.png" alt = " " height = "75" width = "500">
        <li>
            Next, paste your link into the <b>External URL.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            Click <b>Save and return to course.</b> Your video is not available through this link to all users on your Moodle 
            course page.
        </li>
        <li>
            To confirm your link is working correctly, open your link in a new incognito tab or browser. 
        </li>
    </ol>
